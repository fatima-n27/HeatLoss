# Heat Loss Calculator

## About:

<p>
  This project was done over a course of 8 weeks for my Intorduction to Programming class. It takes in user input for information about the room, including size of walls, window glazing, and wall insulation. Based on the information provided in class (i.e. the heat loss values), it then calculates the heat loss for each room, and also for the whole house. 
 
  The final project implemenets multiple concepts of object oriented programming.
