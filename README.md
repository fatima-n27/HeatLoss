# Overview
This is a console-based Heat Loss Calculator developed over 8 weeks for my Programming 1 course. It estimates the heat loss for individual rooms and for an entire house, based on user-provided details such as:

- Wall dimensions
- Window glazing type
- Wall insulation quality

The calculations are based on the heat loss values and formulas provided during the labs.

# Key Features
Interactive User Input: Prompts the user to enter room and insulation details.

Room & Whole House Calculations: Provides heat loss estimates for each room and cumulatively for the house.

Object-Oriented Design: Demonstrates OOP principles including:

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation

Technologies Used
Language: Java

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, basic input handling, mathematical computations.

# Future Improvements
- Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better usability.
- Support for different climates or external temperatures.
- Export results to a CSV or PDF report.
